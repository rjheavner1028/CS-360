# CS-360 Mobile Architect & Programming

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The weight tracking software was created to make it simple for users to monitor and control their daily weight. Safe registration and login, data tracking, data deletion, and SMS notifications to notify users when certain targets or parameters are met are some of its features. The major objective is to provide a simple, easy-to-use tool for managing one's own weight.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A data entry grid, an SMS notification setting page, and a login/registration screen were among the straightforward but functional interfaces needed for the program. The user interface was created with simplicity in mind, making it simple for users to check their progress, enter data, and get notifications. Because accessibility and usability were given top priority in the designs, the app is simple to use and practical for everyday tracking.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I focused on making sure the essential features, including data entry and SMS notifications, were implemented neatly as I was creating the app. With the Android Emulator, I employed iterative testing to find flaws early and guarantee seamless operation. I'll keep employing a test-driven development methodology in the future to preserve scalability and dependability.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I mostly used the Android Emulator to test the app, making sure it worked on various Android versions. To find version-specific flaws and make sure the program works properly on a variety of devices, this procedure was crucial. Minor permissions and UI scaling issues were found and fixed before to the final version.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Integrating the SMS notification feature while making sure it adhered to Android's permission control for message sending was one area where I had to use creativity. I was able to overcome this difficulty by emphasizing limited permissions and privacy-friendly implementation.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
One notable feature was the SMS notification system, where I was able to effectively apply my knowledge of user feedback triggers and permissions management. This proved that I could successfully manage both technical coding difficulties and user-centered design concepts.â€‹
